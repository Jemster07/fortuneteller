Paper fortune tellers are origami toys commonly made by school
children to predict their friends' futures. Fortunes typically predicted
what your futre job would be, who you'd marry, and how much your
future home would be worth. They could also contain prank fortunes
so outrageous they could never become reality.

There is no way to cheat a fortune teller, but there is an element of
randomness determined by the direction the teller opens the toy in
after the user chooses their color. There are 8 available fortunes in
the game - what does your future hold?
